## What's Coffee Shop?  
Right now, a bad name. We should probably think of something mo' clever.  For the time being, think something like [UNTAPPED](https://untappd.com/) for coffee drinkers. It'll be a place where you can check in to local coffee shops, rate the coffee you enjoy (or don't enjoy), comment on what others are drinking, etc...

At it's heart though, it's a [breakable toy](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/apprenticeship-patterns/9780596806842/ch05s03.html) for each of us to challenge our xDD abilities and to learn from one another as we build something kind of fun.  

If you have a feature you'd like to see (or like to be or have us be challenged by) please add it to [waffle](https://waffle.io/xDD-CLE/coffee-shop) or just add it here as a Github issue.  

## Contributing
* checkout the project
* run ```./go```
* That's it! (well - it should be anyway)  

### Don't be shy...
Don't worry about refactoring others' code - just be polite and discuss what's on your mind with them. I personally won't be offended if you refactor / re-write something I've written and hope you'll feel similarly.    

If you're adding new features, please start first with a feature file. Adding ``@wip`` to the top of your feature file will make sure it's not run in CI. Please keep your tests clean and let your tests guide your design as much as possible.
