## What's Coffee Shop?  
Right now, a bad name. We should probably think of something mo' clever.  For the time being, think something like [UNTAPPED](https://untappd.com/) for coffee drinkers. It'll be a place where you can check in to local coffee shops, rate the coffee you enjoy (or don't enjoy), comment on what others are drinking, etc...

At it's heart though, it's a [breakable toy](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/apprenticeship-patterns/9780596806842/ch05s03.html) for each of us to challenge our xDD abilities and to learn from one another as we build something kind of fun.  

If you have a feature you'd like to see (or like to be or have us be challenged by) please add it to [waffle](https://waffle.io/xDD-CLE/coffee-shop) or just add it here as a Github issue.
